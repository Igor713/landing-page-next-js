# Next.js Project

This project was developed with **Next.js**, and during the process, I learned and applied several technologies and tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static-site generation.
- **Formik**: Library for building and validating forms in React.
- **Yup**: Schema validation tool, used alongside Formik for form validation.
- **CSS Modules**: CSS structure that enables local scoping of styles for components.
- **SCSS**: CSS extension language, with the use of **mixins** to optimize and reuse code.

## What I Learned

1. **Formik and Yup**:
   - Building dynamic and validated forms.
   - Integrating Yup for schema validation in forms.
2. **CSS Modules**:
   - How to isolate styles between components to prevent naming conflicts.
3. **SCSS Mixins**:
   - Reusing CSS code blocks using mixins to make the code cleaner and more efficient.
